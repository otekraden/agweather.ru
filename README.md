At this point in time, this project was created for only educational purposes as a portfolio project.

## The Project Idea

The idea of the project came with the following question: <br/>

_What happens if you save the weather forecast data and then compare it with the actual weather that has occurred?_<br/>

Thus, it will be possible to graphically evaluate which of the services is most accurate in certain conditions.

## Stack of Used Technologies

## TODO List

Possible ways to expand the project. Feel free to write commits! ))

1. Add tracked weather parameters. Now there are only 3 of them (temperature, pressure, wind speed). Think about their graphical representation.
2. Add forecast/archive sources. You need to write scraper classes.
